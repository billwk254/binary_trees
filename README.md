Binary Trees

This repository contains the source code for a project on binary trees. The project covers the following topics:

    Basic binary trees
    Binary search trees
    AVL trees
    Max binary heaps

The project includes a header file called binary_trees.h that contains the prototypes for all of the functions used in the project. The project also includes a number of test files that can be used to test the functions.

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, compile the source code using the following command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

This will create an executable file called binary_trees. You can run the executable file to test the functions.
